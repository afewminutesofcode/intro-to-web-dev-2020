# Intro

When you visit a website you view a html document.

All HTML documents consist of

- The doctype
- The html tag
- The head tag
- The body tag

### Doctype

Is required on the first line of a HTML document.

Since HTML5 came out in 2008 this became much more standardised. Now on just about all pages you will see <!doctype html> at the top of your page

### html tags

All content on the page needs to be wrapped in html tags.

### head tags

The contents of the head tag doesn't get displayed to the computer but gets read by the browser to render the page.
Tags such as the title tag appear here.

### body tags

The body tag contains the markup that the user will see when they view the page.
