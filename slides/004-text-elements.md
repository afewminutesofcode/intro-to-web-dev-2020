# Text Elements

There are a number of ways you can add text to a website.

`<p>` - Paragraph Text
`<ul>` - Unordered List (bullet points)
`<ol>` - Ordered List (numbers)
`<a>` - To link some text or image to another page or website
`<div>` - most common element you will use on the page, often used for wrapping and grouping content in order to style it.

To make an unordered list you make a starting and closing (with /) tag. Then add a <li> tag for each item

<ul>
 <li>Item one</li>
 <li>Item two</li>
</ul>
